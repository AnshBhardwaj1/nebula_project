# Real-Time ASL Alphabet Recognition

A lightweight, browser-based demo that captures your webcam feed, recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling letter by letter, displays the accumulated text buffer (up to 5 characters), and speaks it out loud.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project uses an OpenCV + TensorFlow/Keras pipeline to:

1. Capture live video from your webcam  
2. Crop a region of interest (ROI) and preprocess frames  
3. Run a trained ASL-alphabet classifier model on each ROI  
4. Buffer the last 5 predicted characters for stability  
5. Render the live video + overlay text in your browser  
6. Convert the buffered text to speech (TTS)  

Weâ€™ve provided both a **Flask** and a **Streamlit** demoâ€”pick whichever you prefer to spin up quickly.
