üöÄ *Where stars are born!*

</aside>

Welcome to **Nebula**, a two-week-long code-a-thon for developers to showcase their skills by creating impressive software projects, and get them verified by MDG Space!

You‚Äôll begin this journey by selecting and developing your ideas for a period of two weeks.

Following your submission, our team will thoroughly evaluate projects, looking for high-quality ones that follow best practices. After a few rounds of scrutiny, the **top projects** will get verified by us, which means they can be added to your resumes for the upcoming internship season.

If you‚Äôre looking for a project to add to your resume before the intern season verification starts, this is your chance! So what are you waiting for? Find your idea and shoot for the stars with **Nebula!**

# FAQs

- üî¢ How many projects will be selected?
    
    It will depend upon the quality of submissions.
    
- üìö Can I submit an **old** project?
    
    Only if you work on it during the Nebula timeline and add significant features to it. We will give less weightage to projects that you have made before Nebula.
    
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Can I submit **multiple** projects?
    
    Yes, but only one project will be verified per participant.
    
- üíØ What will be the judgement **criteria**?
    1. **Technical skills depicted by project**: Avoid submitting simple projects like a static single-page HTML-CSS project. Choose advanced frameworks and languages to show off your *skillz*
    2. **Knowledge about tech used:** During the interview, you should know what your code does and the working and features of the language/framework that you have used. For example, if you have made a Flutter app, we may ask you questions like ‚ÄúWhat is a `StatelessWidget`?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is a `Stack`?"
- üí°What level of project do you expect? (**Sample Problem Statements)**
    
    We are looking for great projects. Submitting a [Django blog application](https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/) or a [Flutter calculator app](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-calculator-app-using-flutter/) will not make you stand out from the rest.
    
    We have a set of **sample problem statements** that will help you understand the expected level and standard of projects that we are looking for. Please note that these problem statements are for illustrative purposes only, and are not actual problem statements. You can use them for inspiration or come up with something completely different as well. 
    
    - ‚å®Ô∏è Development
        
        1. **Fingerprint Voting System Based Mobile Application**
        
        Develop a mobile application for a fingerprint-based voting system. The app should include secure voter authentication using fingerprint recognition, an intuitive user interface for casting votes, real-time vote tallying, and robust encryption to ensure data integrity and privacy.
        2. **Library Management Application**
        
        Build a full stack library management system. The application should support basic book lending functionalities, categorize books by genre, author, and popularity, and provide separate interfaces for users and administrators. Admin features should include adding/removing books, managing user accounts, and tracking borrowing history.
        3. **Airline Internal Reservation System**
        
        Create a full stack online simulation of an airline reservation system. The system should allow users to view available seats, book and cancel reservations, and receive booking confirmations. The user interface should be intuitive and mobile-responsive, offering real-time updates on seat availability.
        4. **PDF Generator Basic Library**
        Develop a basic PDF generator library from scratch in your preferred programming language. The library should support text and image insertion, customizable formatting options, and page layout settings. It should also include functionality to save and export documents in PDF format.
        5. **OCR Reader Chrome Extension**
        Create a Chrome extension that converts images to text using OCR technology. The extension should allow users to select images from web pages, process the images to extract text, and provide editable and copy-able text output. Additional features might include language detection and support for multiple languages.
        6. **2D Air Hockey Game**
        Develop a 2D version of the popular air hockey game. The game should feature smooth and responsive controls, realistic physics for puck movement, and different levels of difficulty. Additional features could include multiplayer mode, score tracking, and customizable game settings.
